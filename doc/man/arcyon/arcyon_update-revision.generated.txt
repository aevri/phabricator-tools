Diff arguments:
  Mutually exclusive, one is required

  --diff-id INT         the id of the diff to create the file from, this could
                        be the output from a "arcyon raw-diff" call
  --raw-diff-file FILE, -f FILE
                        the file to read the diff from, use '-' for stdin

Output format arguments:
  Mutually exclusive, defaults to "--format-summary"

  --format-summary      will print a human-readable summary of the result.
  --format-id           will print just the id of the revision, for scripting.

  use these optional parameters to override settings present in your
  "~/.arcrc" or ".arcconfig" files

  --uri ADDRESS         address of the phabricator instance to connect to.
  --user NAME           name of the user to connect as.
  --cert HEX            long certificate string of the user to connect as, you
                        can find this string here:
                        http://your.phabricator/settings/panel/conduit/.
                        generally you wouldn't expect to enter this on the
                        command-line and would make an ~/.arcrc file by using
                        '$ arc install-certificate'.
  --act-as-user NAME    name of the user to impersonate (admin only).

Note:

    When updating an existing revision, you should submit a diff versus
    the original file. Otherwise the display in Differential may not be as you
    expect.

    e.g.

    You have 3 versions of your README file:
        README_original.txt
        README_update_1.txt
        README_update_2.txt

    You would like to create a review of these two updates in sequence,
    the correct way to do it is this:

    1. create the review with this diff:
       $ diff -u README_original.txt README_update_1.txt

    2. update the review with this diff:
       $ diff -u README_original.txt README_update_2.txt

Usage examples:

    update revision 99 by piping in a diff:
    $ diff -u file1 file2 | arcyon update-revision 99 fixes -f -
    99

    update revision 99 from diff 2:
    $ arcyon update-revision 99 'fix review issues' -d 2
    99
