                       [INFILE]

Create a raw diff in differential.

positional arguments:
  INFILE              where to read the diff from, can be filename or '-' for
                      stdin. default is stdin if not specified.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit

connection arguments:

  "~/.arcrc" or ".arcconfig" files

  --uri ADDRESS       address of the phabricator instance to connect to.
  --user NAME         name of the user to connect as.
  --cert HEX          long certificate string of the user to connect as, you
                      can find this string here:
                      http://your.phabricator/settings/panel/conduit/.
                      generally you wouldn't expect to enter this on the
                      command-line and would make an ~/.arcrc file by using '$
                      arc install-certificate'.
  --act-as-user NAME  name of the user to impersonate (admin only).

you can use the 'diff id' output from this command as input to the
'arcyon create-revision' and 'arcyon update-revision' commands.

usage examples:
    create a new raw diff by piping in a diff:
    $ diff -u file1 file2 | arcyon raw-diff
    99

    create a new raw diff by piping in a file:
    $ arcyon raw-diff < mydiff
    99

    create a new raw diff by loading a file:
    $ arcyon raw-diff mydiff
    99
