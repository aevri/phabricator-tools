= Proposal to start monitoring Git notes for Arcyd-managed repositories
===============================================================================

There is no way for Arcyd to participate directly in continuous integration at
present.

The command-line tool 'arcanist' participates by performing linting and
unit-tests locally on behalf of the user, according to the configuration in
the per-repo '.arcconfig' file.

Arcyd is an attempt to add value on top of Arcanist by removing the need to
install, configure and interact with it locally - simply push Git branches in
order to create and update reviews.

It would seem a natural extension of Arcyd from the user perspective to then
perform the lint and unit steps automatically configured in  the '.arcconfig'
file upon push and share the results in the review.

This proposal will show how it will be possible to add this functionality
from the point of view of the user without requiring Arcyd to also become
a continuous integration system.

- Sharing human-readable attributes of Git commits using Git notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's not possible to modify the commit message of a commit without also
altering it's commit hash, effectively making a new commit.

Git Notes are a facility added to Git in order to make it possible to
annotate commits post-creation, without altering their commit hash.
