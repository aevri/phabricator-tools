= Proposal to change the arcyd branch naming scheme to "r/ branches"
===============================================================================

The current arcyd branch naming scheme has some usability issues drawbacks,
here is a proposal which attempts to address all of them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Description of the current naming scheme
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branches are currently composed of 3 sections:

  arcyd-review/somedescription/master
  |   prefix  |  description  | base|

1. "prefix" - the prefix unique to arcyd reviews, so that arcyd knows which
   ones to process.  Deliberately long and descriptive to avoid collisions
   with any pre-existing branches.

2. "description" - a description of the branch by the user.

3. "base" - the branch to diff against and to land on.

Note that the third section may be composed of multiple slashes, otherwise
users would not be able to target changes to branches like 'releases/master'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Some drawbacks of the current naming scheme
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(A) 'arcyd' is hard to type correctly

(B) 'arcyd-review' is a long prefix to type

(C) Most branches have the same base - 'master'.  It feels wasteful to repeat
    this and also to risk mis-typing it.

    ('develop' instead of 'master' in some repos, those repos might prefer the
    protection of devgit's 'master' instead though - non-ff to 'develop' could
    set the project back some ways)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Proposed changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Change "prefix" to something much easier to type - the letter 'r'.

(2) Choose a default base for "base" - "master", if no base is specified then
    use this one instead.

(3) Swap the positions of "description" and "base" (if present)

(4) These schemes could co-exist for some time until the deprecated
    'arcyd-review' branches are all gone in favour of the new 'r' branches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With changes (1) and (2) in effect then the above example would change from:

  arcyd-review/somedescription/master

to

  r/somedescription

The effect on a list of reviews is quite dramatic, with the current scheme:

  arcyd-review/D123993/master
  arcyd-review/D124002/feature/redoProxy
  arcyd-review/broadcast_metakey_updown/master
  arcyd-review/carbon_event_bindings/master
  arcyd-review/colors_T122239/master
  arcyd-review/combobox_listener/master
  arcyd-review/command_signal/feature/redoProxy
  arcyd-review/fixStartupCrash/master
  arcyd-review/fix_radiobutton_when_packed/feature/redoProxy
  arcyd-review/hide_unsigned_badges/master
  arcyd-review/hookup_delete_event_to_coordinator/feature/redoProxy
  arcyd-review/menu_T122242/master
  arcyd-review/renameUtils/master

with (1) applied:

  r/D123993/master
  r/D124002/feature/redoProxy
  r/broadcast_metakey_updown/master
  r/carbon_event_bindings/master
  r/colors_T122239/master
  r/combobox_listener/master
  r/command_signal/feature/redoProxy
  r/fixStartupCrash/master
  r/fix_radiobutton_when_packed/feature/redoProxy
  r/hide_unsigned_badges/master
  r/hookup_delete_event_to_coordinator/feature/redoProxy
  r/menu_T122242/master
  r/renameUtils/master

with (1) and (2) applied:

  r/D123993
  r/D124002/feature/redoProxy
  r/broadcast_metakey_updown
  r/carbon_event_bindings
  r/colors_T122239
  r/combobox_listener
  r/command_signal/feature/redoProxy
  r/fixStartupCrash
  r/fix_radiobutton_when_packed/feature/redoProxy
  r/hide_unsigned_badges
  r/hookup_delete_event_to_coordinator/feature/redoProxy
  r/menu_T122242
  r/renameUtils

if we also apply (3) then there's a more subtle gain:

  r/D123993
  r/broadcast_metakey_updown
  r/carbon_event_bindings
  r/colors_T122239
  r/combobox_listener
  r/feature/redoProxy/D124002
  r/feature/redoProxy/command_signal
  r/feature/redoProxy/fix_radiobutton_when_packed
  r/feature/redoProxy/hookup_delete_event_to_coordinator
  r/fixStartupCrash
  r/hide_unsigned_badges
  r/menu_T122242
  r/renameUtils

The branches headed for the same destination now sort together.
