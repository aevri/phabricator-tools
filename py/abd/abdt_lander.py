"""Callables for re-integrating branches upstream.

This component provides a number of 'landers', which will re-integrate a
feature branch back into the current branch, which is assumed to be upstream.

In other words, the 'landers' land a supplied branch on the current branch.

Landers have the interface:
    def lander(repo, feature, author_name, author_email, message)

On success the lander will return a string summary of the landing operation
for a human to review.

If the lander fails to land then it will raise a LanderException with details
of the failure.
