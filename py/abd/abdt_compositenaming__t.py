#                                   TEST PLAN
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here we detail the things we are concerned to test and specify which tests
# cover those concerns.
#
# Concerns:
# [XB] review names that are globally known to be bad are not accepted
# [XB] tracker names that are globally known to be bad are not accepted
# [XC] names that are known to be potential reviews aren't accepted as trackers
# [XC] names that are known to be potential trackers aren't accepted as reviews
# [XD] ReviewBranches created by the scheme have the expected attributes
# [XD] ReviewBranches created by the scheme can create expected TrackerBranches
# [XD] TrackerBranches created by the scheme have the expected attributes
# [XD] there is a 1-1 relationship between tracker params and tracker names
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tests:
# [ A] XXX: test_A_Breathing
# [XA] check_XA_Breathing
# [XB] check_XB_globally_invalid_review_tracker_names
# [XC] check_XC_potentially_valid_review_tracker_names
# [XD] check_XD_valid_reviews
